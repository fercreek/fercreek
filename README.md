Detalles generales a ajustar
Fechas en Fountain

Tienes: Jun 2025 - Dec 2054. Eso suena a typo. Debería ser algo tipo:
Jun 2024 – Dec 2024 o Jun 2024 – Present, según aplique.

Consistencia en fechas y nombres

Usa siempre el mismo formato: por ejemplo Mar 2020 – Sep 2021 (tres letras, mismo estilo de guion).

Asegurate de que títulos como Senior Lead Software Eng. queden homogéneos: puede ser Senior Lead Software Engineer.

Título de sección

En vez de Professional Experience Summary usaría solo Professional Experience (más estándar).

Si querés, en el siguiente paso podemos pulir también la parte de “Personal Products/Projects” para que suenen más alineados a impacto (KPIs, métricas, tipo de clientes, etc.).

esta muy extenso mi cv, que podira mejroarlo
Contreras Code said:

Thought for 24s
Tienes razón, está largo 😅 Pero está bueno el contenido, sólo hay que editarlo con mala leche para que quede en 1–2 páginas máximo.

Te dejo primero qué cambiaría y luego un ejemplo de versión recortada a partir de Apptegy.

1. Qué podrías mejorar (sin perder valor)
Recortar experiencia antigua

Todo lo de antes de 2017 (Logitrack, BBXM, eCareSoft, primer freelance) ya no necesita 3 bullets cada uno.

Mejor: agruparlo en una sección tipo “Earlier Experience” con 2–3 bullets totales.

Dar protagonismo a lo reciente

Reclutadores miran sobre todo los últimos 5–7 años.

Deja con 3 bullets: Buk, Fountain, Apptegy, Bviral, Syscap, Civica.

Lo anterior: resumido.

Reducir texto en proyectos y extras

“Personal Products/Projects”: deja 1 línea por proyecto, muy directa.

Hackathons y premios: 2–3 bullets máximo, no lista larga.

Lo de bachata: lo dejaría, pero en 1 bullet al final (te diferencia, está buenísimo).

Arreglar detalles

Cambia Jun 2025 - Dec 2054 por algo realista, ej: Jun 2024 – Dec 2024 (o “Present” si sigue).

Cambia Professional Experience Summary → Professional Experience.

ahora quiero poner en descripcion de linkedin l que hice en fountain y buk sin tener problemas de NDA
Contreras Code said:

Thought for 22s
Buenísima idea pensarlo con NDA en mente 👌

Te dejo textos listos para copiar en la sección de experiencia de LinkedIn para Fountain y Buk. Todos son suficientemente generales como para no meterte en problemas de confidencialidad.

Fountain – opciones de descripción
Opción 1 (clara y segura)
At Fountain, I was part of the support engineering team, helping keep the platform stable and reliable for high-volume customers. I investigated and resolved production issues, collaborated closely with product and frontend teams, and turned user feedback from support tickets into small UX/UI improvements that made the product easier to use day to day.

Opción 2 (un poco más técnica)
I worked on the support engineering team at Fountain, focusing on diagnosing and fixing production issues in a high-traffic environment. I used modern debugging and AI-assisted tooling to speed up root-cause analysis, reduced resolution times for critical tickets, and partnered with product and design to ship targeted UX/UI improvements based on real user pain points.

Opción 3 (en español, por si quieres duplicar perfil)
En Fountain formé parte del equipo de soporte técnico, enfocado en mantener la plataforma estable para clientes de alto volumen. Me dediqué a investigar y resolver incidencias en producción, usar herramientas modernas para acelerar el diagnóstico y colaborar con producto y diseño para lanzar mejoras puntuales de UX/UI basadas en el feedback de los usuarios.

Buk – opciones de descripción
Opción 1 (segura y orientada a producto)
At Buk, I joined a Chile-based product engineering team focused on building and iterating features for the core application. I worked on a consistent design system and reusable UI components, helping the team ship new features faster while keeping the user experience cohesive across the product.

Opción 2 (incluyendo la idea de DSL pero sin entrar en detalles sensibles)
I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Buk, collaborating with a Chile-based, cross-functional team. I helped evolve an internal component system (similar to a DSL) used to define and assemble UI elements, which improved design consistency and developer productivity, and I contributed to the development of new product features end-to-end.

Opción 3 (en español)
En Buk trabajé con un equipo chileno de producto, desarrollando nuevas funcionalidades para la aplicación principal y manteniendo una experiencia de usuario consistente. Participé en el diseño y evolución de un sistema interno de componentes (tipo DSL) para construir interfaces reutilizables y acelerar el desarrollo de nuevas features.

Por qué esto es NDA-safe
No mencionamos detalles internos específicos (nombres de proyectos internos, nombres de clientes, métricas privadas).

Hablamos de cosas genéricas de cualquier SaaS: soporte, features, componentes, diseño consistente, UX/UI.

Mencionamos un “internal component system (similar to a DSL)” sin explicar sintaxis, nombre interno ni detalles técnicos propietarios.

Si quieres, en el siguiente paso puedo ayudarte a escribir un About / Acerca de de LinkedIn que conecte todo: Buk + Fountain + Apptegy en un párrafo o dos que te vendan como senior backend/frontend/product engineer.

invbestiga que lengaujes son los mejores pagados o seran de los mejroes pagando, tomando enc uenta mi perfil y que quiero aprender algo mas pagado, en ingles, remoto
Contreras Code said:

Thought for 1m 53s
Short version: con tu perfil (Ruby/Rails, JS, microservices, DevOps, senior) los mejores “bets” para subir salario en remoto en inglés no son Perl raros, sino:

Go (Golang)

Rust

Doblar la apuesta en Ruby pero en mejor mercado

algo de TypeScript sólido (backend/full-stack)

Te explico con datos y luego te digo qué haría yo si fuera tú.

1. Qué lenguajes están mejor pagados hoy
Varios reportes recientes coinciden en que las bandas más altas de salario se concentran en unos pocos lenguajes “nicho”:

Un estudio de Index.dev pone como top: Solidity, Erlang, Scala, Perl, Ruby, con medias de ~130–170k USD en EE. UU. remoto. 
Index.dev

Otro ranking global 2025 combina encuestas y ofertas y vuelve a listar Rust, Solidity, Go, Erlang, Python, Scala, TypeScript, Ruby entre los mejor pagados. 
Softspace Solutions

La guía de Remotly (plataforma de empleos remotos) señala que para remoto bien pagado en 2025, las skills más demandadas son TypeScript, Go, Rust, Python + cloud/DevOps. 
Remotly

El survey de Stack Overflow 2024 indica que Erlang y Clojure están entre los que más ganan, con medianas >95k USD, sobre todo por ser lenguajes poco comunes usados por gente senior. 
Stack Overflow
+1

Conclusión rápida:
💰 Lenguajes con techo muy alto: Solidity, Erlang/Clojure, Scala, Rust, Go, Ruby.
📈 Lenguajes con mucha demanda remota: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust. 
Daily.dev
+1

2. Bajado a tu realidad: qué tiene sentido para ti
Tu stack actual:

Fuerte en backend web: Ruby on Rails, microservicios, APIs.

Frontend razonable: Vue, React, algo de Next.

DevOps/Cloud: Docker, AWS/infra, CI/CD.

Experiencia senior, liderazgo, planning, hablar con clientes.

Con eso en mente, yo priorizaría así:

2.1 Go (Golang) – mejor equilibrio sueldo / demanda / dificultad
Por qué:

Go aparece constante como uno de los lenguajes mejor pagados y muy demandados para backend, infra y DevOps. 
Pesto Tech
+2
Softspace Solutions
+2

Se usa muchísimo en microservicios, plataformas de developers, infra cloud, Kubernetes tooling, justo donde encaja tu experiencia de Apptegy.

Es muy popular en empresas USA con remoto (SaaS B2B, dev tools, fintech, etc.).

Encaje contigo:

Ya trabajaste con microservices + DevOps → pasar a Go en un equipo de plataforma, SRE o backend infra es bastante natural.

Sintaxis simple; si vienes de Ruby/JS no duele tanto el cambio.

Tipo de rol remoto que podrías apuntar:

Senior Backend Engineer (Go / Microservices)

Platform Engineer (Go, Kubernetes, AWS)

Senior Backend Engineer – Payments / Fintech (Go)

👉 Si buscas subir sueldo en 12–18 meses sin reinventarte, Go es el primer pick.

2.2 Rust – máximo potencial, más curva y más nicho
Por qué paga tanto:

Rust se usa mucho en Web3, crypto, sistemas de alto rendimiento, infra de seguridad, y los salarios ahí suelen ser muy altos (150k+ USD). 
Web3 Jobs
+2
BeInCrypto
+2

Encuestas y portales de empleo muestran medias alrededor de 130–150k USD para Rust devs en EE. UU., con picos >200k USD. 
Wellfound
+1

Peeeero:

Mercado más pequeño y exigente: muchas ofertas piden experiencia previa en Rust + sistemas/compilers/crypto.

Curva de aprendizaje alta; no es “aprendo esto en 3 meses y ya gano el doble”.

Encaje contigo:

Si te gusta la parte técnica heavy (concurrencia, performance, seguridad) y no te asusta estudiar duro, Rust puede ser tu apuesta de “alto riesgo / alto retorno”.

Puede combinarse con tu experiencia en microservices y DevOps, pero normalmente en un nivel más bajo (infra, tooling, blockchain infra).

Roles típicos:

Rust Backend Engineer (Web3 / Blockchain)

Systems Engineer (Rust)

Security / Infrastructure Engineer (Rust, C++)

👉 Yo pondría Rust como segunda prioridad, ideal como side-project mientras sigues facturando bien con Ruby/JS/Go.

2.3 Ruby – no la descartes: ya está en el club de mejor pagadas
Aunque mucha gente la ve “vieja”, los datos dicen que Ruby sigue pagando muy bien:

En rankings de 2025, Ruby aparece con medias ~130–135k USD en USA, dentro del top 10 de mejor pagadas. 
Index.dev

Para roles “Ruby on Rails Developer (Remote)” en Glassdoor, el promedio ronda los 100k–120k USD, con top earners >200k USD. 
Glassdoor
+1

Con tu CV (Rails, microservicios, liderazgo técnico, trato con clientes) ya estás posicionado para el rango alto de Ruby.
Muchas empresas remote-first (SaaS B2B, YC startups, producto) siguen apostando por Rails.

👉 Lo más rentable a corto plazo probablemente no es “aprender otro lenguaje”, sino:

Apuntar a empresas USA/Europa que pagan bien por Rails,

Pulir tu perfil de Senior/Staff Backend o incluso Tech Lead,

Y en paralelo, añadir Go o Rust.

2.4 TypeScript (full-stack / backend) – no top-1 en sueldo, pero sí en oportunidades remotas
Guías de remoto y encuestas muestran que TypeScript + React/Next + Node está en el núcleo de lo que buscan para remoto. 
Remotly
+2
Daily.dev
+2

No es el lenguaje más pagado “en ranking puro”, pero hay muchísimas más vacantes y muchas del rango 120k–160k USD para seniors.

Dado que ya haces JS/React/Vue, puede ser:

Tu forma de posicionarte como Senior Full-stack (TS/React + Rails/Go), lo cual es muy atractivo para startups.

Un plus para roles backend (Node/TS) bien pagados.

3. ¿Y qué hay de Erlang, Elixir, Scala, Solidity…?
Erlang / Elixir:
Surveys y foros comentan que pagan por encima de la media, en parte por baja oferta y perfiles senior. 
Stack Overflow
+1

Pros: buen encaje si te gusta lo funcional + concurrente, y vienes de Ruby (Elixir/Phoenix “se siente” familiar).

Contras: mercado pequeño; menos ofertas remotas comparado con Go/TS/Python.

Scala:
Muy bien pagada en big data, adtech, fintech. 
Index.dev
+1

Pros: sueldos altos, mucho en banca/finanzas.

Contras: necesitas entrar en el ecosistema JVM + data; no es tan directa la transición desde Rails a menos que te metas a data/streaming.

Solidity:
Top de los rankings en salario (~160k+). 
Index.dev

Pros: sueldos altísimos en Web3.

Contras: mercado volátil, mucha estafa, necesitas tolerancia al riesgo y gusto real por crypto.

Para tu perfil, yo sólo consideraría:

Elixir si te entusiasma el ecosistema y quieres algo cercano a Ruby pero más nicho.

Scala/Solidity sólo si te llama mucho la atención data/finanzas o crypto.

4. Plan concreto para ti (sin humo)
Si yo fuera tú y quiero subir sueldo remoto en inglés en 12–24 meses:

Paso 1 – Exprimir lo que ya tienes (0–6 meses)
Posicionarte como Senior Backend / Tech Lead Ruby + JS/TS para USA/Europa:

CV y LinkedIn full en inglés (ya vamos avanzados con eso).

Enfatizar: microservices, DevOps, stakeholder communication, liderazgo.

Apuntar a empresas que ya pagan bien a Rails devs (producto, SaaS B2B, no agencias).

Paso 2 – Apostar por Go como nuevo “money language” (3–12 meses)
Hacer un mini roadmap de Go:

Tour oficial + libro ligero.

1–2 microservicios de ejemplo (API + background jobs + Docker).

Conectar Go con tu experiencia:

“Built microservices in Go for X (side project / freelance) using Docker, PostgreSQL, AWS”.

Empezar a aplicar a roles Ruby + Go o Go + cualquier cosa.

Paso 3 – Rust como plus opcional (6–24 meses)
Sólo si te enamoras del lenguaje y el type system.

1–2 proyectos open source / side projects visibles (CLI, pequeño motor, algo de WebAssembly o similar).

Apuntar a empresas muy específicas (infra, security, Web3) que paguen arriba de 150k y valoren Rust.

5. Resumen en una frase
Con tu perfil actual, el mejor combo para remoto en inglés bien pagado es:

Short term: exprimir Ruby + TS en empresas mejor pagadas.
Mid term: añadir Go como backend/infra para entrar a bandas altas.
Optional high-risk / high-reward: aprender Rust para roles muy especializados.

Si querés, en el próximo mensaje puedo armarte:

O un texto corto para tu LinkedIn tipo “Open to work – Go / Ruby / Remote”.

Totalmente de acuerdo: no solo hay que listar tecnologías, sino demostrar profundidad (años/experiencia real). Te armo una versión mejorada de tu sección de skills usando lo que me diste:

Skills

Backend  
- Ruby & Ruby on Rails — 9+ years building and maintaining production web applications and APIs.  
- Python & Django — 7+ years developing backend services, APIs, and background jobs.  
- Node.js — experience building APIs and integrations for web platforms.  
- Spring Boot — experience maintaining and extending logistics and transportation systems.

Frontend  
- JavaScript — 9+ years working on web applications and frontends.  
- Vue.js — 3+ years building SPAs and admin dashboards.  
- React & Next.js — 2+ years building modern frontends and SSR/SPA applications.  
- AngularJS & Ionic — experience creating hybrid mobile apps and internal tools.

Data & Storage  
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, RethinkDB — schema design, complex queries, and performance tuning for production systems.

DevOps & Cloud  
- Docker — 5+ years containerizing applications and improving development workflows.  
- Amazon Web Services, Heroku, Render — deploying, monitoring, and operating web applications in production.
Si lo quieres aún más compacto para CV, puedes usar una línea inicial que ya “venda” la seniority:

Backend: Ruby & Ruby on Rails (9+ yrs), Python & Django (7+ yrs), Node.js, Spring Boot  
Frontend: JavaScript (9+ yrs), Vue.js (3+ yrs), React & Next.js (2+ yrs), AngularJS, Ionic  
Data & Storage: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, RethinkDB  
DevOps & Cloud: Docker (5+ yrs), AWS, Heroku, Render
Con eso:

Dejas clarísimo dónde sos senior de verdad (Ruby/Rails, JS, Python/Django).

No inventamos años para lo que no mencionaste, solo hablamos de “experience” de forma genérica.

Es fácil de escanear para reclutadores en remoto.

quiero publicar ambas versiones, convendria hacerlo el miosmo dia, poner dos popst aparte, que es lo ams recombendable para abarcar ambos nichos
Contreras Code said:

Thought for 32s
Buenísima pregunta, porque aquí no es solo “traducir” sino cómo usar bien el algoritmo 😄

¿Mismo día o no?
En tu cuenta principal (Instagram):

No haría dos posts casi iguales el mismo día en el feed: el algoritmo puede “canibalizarlos” y la gente los siente repetidos.

Mejor opción:

1 solo post en el feed (usa el flyer en español, que es tu mercado base)

Texto bilingüe en la descripción: primero español, luego inglés.

En el carrusel puedes poner:

Slide 1: flyer en español

Slide 2: flyer en inglés

Así abarcas ambos nichos sin duplicar contenido.

¿Y el post en inglés?
Úsalo fuerte en LinkedIn (y si tienes, en X/Twitter): ahí el inglés tiene más sentido.

En Instagram podés reutilizar el arte en inglés una o dos semanas después, como:

“Working with clients in LatAm and abroad to build SaaS products…”

Enfocado más a público internacional.

Resumen rápido de estrategia
Hoy:

Instagram feed → Post bilingüe (flyer ES + EN en carrusel, caption ES/EN).

Historias → 1 story en español, 1 en inglés taggeando @contrerascode, studiolink.online, vayla.dance.

LinkedIn:

Post solo en inglés, con el flyer en inglés + links a tus productos.

En 1–2 semanas:

Nuevo post en Instagram usando solo la versión en inglés, apuntando a clientes de fuera de México/Latam.

Si quieres, te armo el caption bilingüe para el post único de Instagram con carrusel (ES primero, EN después).

basado en mi exp, cuando seria un costo por hora justo
Contreras Code said:

Thought for 1m 13s
Con lo que ya sé de tu perfil, te contesto directo:

1. Rango rápido recomendado
Para clientes internacionales (US / Europa, remoto, en inglés):

No cobrar menos de: 40 USD/h

Rango sano para tu seniority: 50–70 USD/h

Top (consultoría muy especializada / proyectos cortos): 70–85 USD/h

Para clientes locales (México / Latam, pymes, en MXN):

Con el tipo de cambio alrededor de 18 MXN por dólar 
Wise

Equivalente:

40 USD/h ≈ 720 MXN/h

50 USD/h ≈ 900 MXN/h

70 USD/h ≈ 1,260 MXN/h

Un rango razonable para ti localmente sería entre 700 y 1,200 MXN/h dependiendo del tipo de cliente.

2. ¿Por qué esos números con tu experiencia?
Tu perfil, resumiendo:

~9 años con Ruby / Ruby on Rails y JavaScript

~7 años con Python / Django

Experiencia fuerte en backend, microservicios, DevOps, front (Vue/React/Next)

Has sido Senior / Lead / COO, has liderado equipos, hablado con clientes y construido tus propios SaaS (StudioLink, Vayla).

Eso es claramente Senior.

Para ese nivel, agencias que colocan devs de Latam con clientes de EEUU hablan de rangos típicos de 40–70+ USD/h para seniors y hasta 85 USD/h en algunos casos. 
Abbacus Technologies -
+3
Index.dev
+3
LATAM.Hire
+3

Así que estar en 50–70 USD/h como independiente que ofrece:

desarrollo,

arquitectura,

un poco de product / consultoría,

es completamente coherente con mercado.

3. Cómo elegir tu número exacto
Te propongo esta regla:

Clientes pymes locales / presupuestos ajustados:
40–50 USD/h (o su equivalente en MXN)
→ Siempre dejando claro que es ya un precio con “descuento” por ser relación larga o local.

Startups bien fondeadas / clientes de EEUU o Europa:
55–70 USD/h
→ Aquí vendes no sólo código, sino experiencia en SaaS, arquitectura y acompañamiento de producto.

Consultoría estratégica / rescate de proyecto / trabajo muy especializado:
70–85 USD/h
→ Revisión de arquitectura, migraciones complejas, performance, etc.

Además, siempre puedes usar esto internamente y al cliente ofrecerle precio por proyecto (“este módulo cuesta X”, “esta MVP cuesta Y”) pero calculado con ese valor hora detrás.

4. Mi recomendación para arrancar
Si hoy estás cobrando menos, yo haría:

Fijar oficialmente para clientes nuevos de fuera de México:
👉 Base: 55 USD/h

Para locales o amigos/emprendedores cercanos:
👉 40–45 USD/h como “tarifa especial”.

Después de 2–3 proyectos cerrados a ese precio, subir tu base a 60–65 USD/h.

Si quieres, en el próximo mensaje te ayudo a redactar un pequeño rate card (tabla simple) para mandar por WhatsApp / correo a clientes con 2–3 paquetes (MVP, mantenimiento mensual, consultoría, etc.) usando estos números.

Te armo un About Me pensado para LinkedIn / web, en inglés, enfocado en: senior backend, SaaS, remoto, y tus productos propios 👇

I’m a senior software engineer focused on building, scaling, and maintaining web applications and SaaS products.

Over the last 9+ years I’ve worked mainly with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL, and 7+ years with Python and Django, building everything from internal tools to customer-facing platforms. I enjoy working end-to-end: understanding the problem, shaping the solution with stakeholders, designing the architecture, shipping features, and iterating based on real user feedback.

Beyond client work, I’ve also built and shipped my own products, including:
- Studio Link – a platform to help dance studios and gyms manage attendance, payments, and communication.
- Vayla – a tool to streamline dance competitions by automating judging and scoring.

My toolkit includes: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Python, Django, JavaScript, Vue.js, React, Next.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, and cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, and Render. I care a lot about clean code, maintainable architectures, and balancing speed with long-term quality.

I’m currently open to remote opportunities and collaborations, especially on projects that involve SaaS, product thinking, and backend-heavy work. If you’re looking for someone who can own features end-to-end and communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, I’d be happy to connect.

Por si quieres una sección aparte en tu página:

Products

Studio Link – Management for dance studios and gyms  
Studio Link is a SaaS platform built to help dance studios and gyms move away from spreadsheets and manual admin work. It centralizes:

- Class schedules and instructor assignments  
- Attendance tracking and student management  
- Memberships, plans, and payment tracking  
- Basic analytics so owners can understand which classes and time slots perform best  

The goal is to give studio owners a clear picture of their business in one place, and free up time so they can focus on teaching and growing their community.

Vayla – Judging and scoring for dance competitions  
Vayla is a web application that simplifies the logistics behind dance competitions. It allows organizers to:

- Configure events, categories, and divisions  
- Assign judges and capture their scores digitally  
- Calculate results and rankings automatically in real time  
- Export results and share them quickly with participants  

By automating scoring and result generation, Vayla reduces human error, speeds up award ceremonies, and makes the whole experience more transparent for dancers and organizers.

Contreras Code said:

Thought for 1m 9s
Buenísima pregunta, aquí es donde se gana o se pierde tiempo en la búsqueda 😅
Te dejo sitios concretos, separados por:

Rails (fijo + remoto)

Rails/Next/Go en general

Freelance/contratos

Y al final, qué usaría yo en tu caso.

1️⃣ Rails-only / muy enfocados en Ruby on Rails
Estos son los que más valen la pena para tu perfil actual:

Ruby On Remote – Solo remoto y muy Ruby/Rails-friendly. Curan vacantes, muchos salarios publicados y full-time bien pagados. 
Ruby On Remote
+1

Rails Job Board (jobs.rubyonrails.org) – El job board “oficial” del ecosistema Rails, con muchas vacantes senior totalmente remotas. 
Rails Job Board
+1

GoRails Jobs
+1

We Work Remotely – Ruby on Rails – Filtro específico de “Remote Ruby on Rails Jobs”, solo trabajos remotos. 
We Work Remotely
+1

Working Nomads – Remote Ruby on Rails Jobs – Agregador de vacantes 100% remotas en Rails, incluyendo full-time, part-time y freelance. 
Working Nomads

➡️ Para tu seniority en Rails, estos boards son donde puedes encontrar cosas tipo 80–150k+ USD según empresa y región.

Nota: RailsDevs fue muy bueno para freelancers Rails, pero su creador anunció que lo está cerrando, así que ya no lo pondría como apuesta a futuro. 
GitHub
+1

2️⃣ Rails, Next.js y Go en job boards remotos generales
Aquí no son solo Rails, pero puedes filtrar por Rails / Next.js / Go y “remote”:

Multi-stack / global
Arc.dev – Tiene secciones específicas de Ruby, Next.js y Golang, todas orientadas a remoto bien pagado (startups globales). 
Arc
+2
Arc

Get on Board
+1

Extra útil para ti (México)
remotely.mx – No es un job board nuevo, sino un agregador: junta trabajos remotos “Mexico-friendly” desde sitios como jobs.rubyonrails.org, RubyOnRemote, GoRails, RemoteOK, etc., y los muestra con rango salarial. 
Remotely

3️⃣ Freelance / proyectos por hora (Rails, Next, Go)
Aquí vas más por proyectos que por puesto fijo:

Upwork – Muchísimas vacantes de freelance para Ruby on Rails, y en general JS/Next/Node. Tienen incluso una página específica de “Ruby on Rails freelance jobs” donde mencionan que devs Rails cobran entre 35 y 150 USD/h. 
Upwork

Toptal – Red de talento “top 3%” para freelance/contratos largos; tienen vertical de Ruby on Rails. Tasas más altas, pero proceso de filtro más pesado. 
Toptal
+1

Lemon.io – Plataforma de devs vetados, con foco fuerte en Rails, JS y Python, y tarifas típicas de 45–80 USD/h para el “Startup plan”. 
Index.dev

Braintrust – Marketplace de talento freelance con perfil tech fuerte (incluye Rails); trabajan mucho con clientes US/Europe y contratos remotos. 
Braintrust

También podrías mirar:

Contra, Gun.io, Arc Talent, etc., pero con solo 2–3 plataformas fuertes bien cuidadas ya puedes llenar pipeline si tu perfil está bien armado.

4️⃣ Cómo lo usaría yo en tu lugar (con tu perfil)
Con tu experiencia (Rails senior, JS, algo de Next, empezando Go), yo haría esto:

A. Para Rails full-time remoto
Crear alertas/perfil en:

RubyOnRemote

Ruby on Rails Jobs

GoRails Job Board

Working Nomads (filtro “Ruby on Rails”)

We Work Remotely (Ruby on Rails)

Usar remotely.mx como “resumen” de todo lo anterior, pero filtrado a “friendly con México / LatAm”. 
Remotely

B. Para empezar a aplicar a Next.js y Go
Mientras terminas de reforzar Next y Go:

Para Next.js:

Arc.dev (Next.js)

RemoteRocketship (Next.js)

GetOnBoard (Next.js)

DevJobsScanner (Remote Next.js)

Para Go:

GolangProjects

Golang.cafe

Arc.dev (Golang)

GetOnBoard (Golang)

RemoteRocketship / RemoteLeaf con filtro Go

Ahí puedes apuntar primero a roles donde tu fuerte siga siendo Rails/Backend y Go/Next sumen como plus (o donde piden “willing to learn Go”).

C. Para freelance bien pagado
Yo me enfocaría en 2–3 plataformas máximo para no dispersarte:

Upwork: un perfil muy bien escrito en inglés, donde muestres:

9+ años Rails

SaaS (Studio Link, Vayla)

experiencia con educación, logística, civic tech.

Lemon.io o Braintrust si quieres algo más curado/vetado (menos volumen, pero clientes mejores).

Y mantendría tu propia web + Instagram + LinkedIn como canal directo para clientes que quieran algo tipo Studio Link / Vayla.

Si quieres, en el siguiente mensaje puedo ayudarte a:

Definir keywords exactas para tus alertas (ej: “Ruby on Rails, remote, Latin America friendly, senior”).

O escribir un mensaje en inglés para mandar como “first contact” cuando apliques a vacantes de Rails/Next/Go.

retomaremos el texot para estos post, vamos a evlauar que esta mejor asi como el texto
Contreras Code said:

Thought for 26s
Va, usemos esos dos flyers como base y los terminamos de pulir: texto dentro del flyer + texto para el post.

1️⃣ Qué mejorar en los flyers
En inglés (imagen derecha)
Cambiar “EXPERTICE” → “EXPERTISE”

“DIGITAL PLATFORMS” en plural está bien, yo sólo lo dejaría en una sola línea si el diseño aguanta.

Bullets: quitar comas al final y hacerlos un poco más claros.

Propuesta de texto en el flyer (EN):

Header:

EXPERTISE IN DIGITAL PLATFORMS

Subtítulo:

BUILT TO GROW AND SCALE YOUR BUSINESS

Bullets:

Web platforms & business websites

Social media and third-party integration

Custom systems tailored to your workflows

Bottom:

LET’S BUILD YOUR DIGITAL BUSINESS

En español (imagen izquierda)
Mejor en plural: “PLATAFORMAS DIGITALES”.

“HAGO CRECER TU NEGOCIO” está bueno, muy directo.

Bullets también un poco más específicos.

Propuesta de texto en el flyer (ES, mexicano):

Header:

EXPERTO EN PLATAFORMAS DIGITALES

Subtítulo:

HAGO CRECER TU NEGOCIO EN LÍNEA

Bullets:

Desarrollo de plataformas y páginas web

Integración con redes sociales y sistemas externos

Estructura y automatización digital desde cero

Bottom:

CONSTRUYAMOS TU NEGOCIO DIGITAL

2️⃣ Texto para el post con flyer en español (Instagram / FB)
¿Tu negocio ya tiene una plataforma digital que de verdad trabaje por ti?

Ayudo a negocios y academias a crear sistemas tipo SaaS: desde la página web y el área de clientes, hasta la automatización de cobros, inscripciones y comunicación.

Además de trabajar con clientes, también desarrollé mis propias plataformas:

que flyer vamos a usar usemos la recomendacion, pensando que tener ambos 
Contreras Code said:

Thought for 36s
Buenísima pausa para pensar esto bien 🙌

Voy directo:

1. ¿Qué flyer usar?
Yo haría esto:

Instagram / Facebook (tu cuenta principal)

Post con carrusel de 2 imágenes:

Slide 1 → Flyer en español (para México/Latam)

Slide 2 → Flyer en inglés (para gente que te sigue y habla inglés)

Un solo caption bilingüe, así no duplicas contenido ni confundes al algoritmo.

LinkedIn

Usa solo el flyer en inglés con un texto más profesional en inglés.

O sea: sí usamos ambos flyers, pero en un mismo post (IG) en vez de dos posts separados el mismo día.

2. Ajuste de texto pensando que Studio Link y Vayla son “referencias”
La idea es mostrarlos como ejemplos de cosas que ya construiste, no como “mi único producto”.

Caption para Instagram (post con ambos flyers) – Español mexicano primero

Briefly share why you will excel in this role
﻿

Do you have 4+ years of Ruby on Rails experience? 
﻿

Briefly describe your most significant Ruby on Rails contribution 
﻿

Have you worked at a high-growth SaaS company? If not, which industries have you worked in? 
Contreras Code said:

Thought for 18s
Perfecto, te dejo respuestas cortas y listas para copiar/pegar en inglés. Ajusté todo a tu background real (Rails senior, SaaS, Apptegy/Buk/Fountain, etc.).

1) Briefly share why you will excel in this role

I will excel in this role because I’ve spent the last 9+ years building and scaling Ruby on Rails applications in SaaS environments, working closely with product, design, and support teams. I’m comfortable owning features end-to-end: from understanding the problem and shaping the solution, to designing the architecture, shipping, and iterating based on real user feedback. My experience spans high-growth products, legacy modernization, and greenfield builds, so I know how to balance speed with long-term maintainability and clean code.

2) Do you have 4+ years of Ruby on Rails experience?

Yes – I have over 9 years of professional experience with Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

3) Briefly describe your most significant Ruby on Rails contribution

One of my most significant contributions was at a SaaS company in the education space, where I helped design and implement backend services in a microservices architecture using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. I worked on core features used daily by school districts, improving reliability, performance, and deployment workflows. I also led refactors of existing Rails code to make it easier to maintain and extend, which allowed the team to ship new functionality faster and with fewer production issues.

(Si quieres, puedo cambiar este ejemplo por uno centrado en Studio Link o Vayla.)

4) Have you worked at a high-growth SaaS company? If not, which industries have you worked in?

Yes. I’ve worked at high-growth SaaS companies in the K–12 education space, HR/people management, and hiring/onboarding. Beyond that, I’ve also built software for civic technology, logistics and transportation, marketing/advertising, and small business tools, as well as launching my own SaaS products.

Si me dices qué tipo de rol es (solo backend, full-stack, infra, etc.), puedo afinar aún más las respuestas para que parezcan hechas a la medida del puesto.

You said:
mas humano, mas real
Contreras Code said:

Thought for 10s
Perfecto, vamos a bajarlo a algo que suene más como tú y menos como texto de recruiter 😅
Te dejo respuestas cortas, humanas y honestas, listas para pegar.

Briefly share why you will excel in this role

I’ve spent most of my career building and maintaining Ruby on Rails products, especially in SaaS and product teams. I’m comfortable taking a feature from “rough idea” to production: talking through the problem, proposing a simple design, shipping it, and then iterating once we see how real users react.

I work well with product, design, and support because I genuinely care that the thing we ship is useful, not just “done”. I also bring experience from my own products (like Studio Link and Vayla), so I’m very aware of trade-offs, deadlines, and long-term maintainability.

Do you have 4+ years of Ruby on Rails experience?

Yes. I have a little over 9 years of professional experience with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, across several companies and my own products.

Briefly describe your most significant Ruby on Rails contribution

One of the contributions I’m most proud of is Studio Link, a Rails-based SaaS I built to help studios manage classes, attendance, and payments in one place. I designed the data model, built the subscription and billing flow, and implemented the dashboards that owners use to understand how their business is doing.

It started as a side project, but it’s now used in production by real customers, and their feedback directly shaped many of the features. That experience taught me a lot about shipping, listening, and improving a Rails app over time.

(Si prefieres que usemos un ejemplo de Apptegy/Buk en lugar de Studio Link, te lo reformulo.)

Have you worked at a high-growth SaaS company? If not, which industries have you worked in?

Yes. I’ve worked at high-growth SaaS companies in different areas:

K–12 education (Apptegy)

HR / people management (Buk)

Hiring and onboarding (Fountain)

Outside of that, I’ve also built software for civic tech, logistics and transportation, marketing/advertising, and tools for small businesses.

Buenísimo que tengas otro side project 👌 En vez de solo mencionarlos sueltos, te conviene que tu README de GitHub tenga una sección clarita de “Side Projects” donde se vea que no solo trabajas para clientes, sino que también construyes productos propios.

Te dejo el README actualizado, incluyendo una sección para Studio Link, Vayla y dejando listo el espacio para este nuevo side project (solo tendrías que cambiar el nombre/URL y la descripción corta).

# Hi there, I'm Fercreek 👋

I'm a **software developer** focused on building robust, reliable, and user-friendly web applications and SaaS products.

## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack

**Core stack**

- **Languages:** Ruby, Python, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Ruby on Rails, Django  
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Vue.js  

**Data & Platforms**

- **Databases / Backend-as-a-Service:** PostgreSQL, Supabase  

**Infra & Deployment**

- **Containers & Dev:** Docker  
- **Hosting / Deployment:** Vercel, Render  

**Currently exploring (side projects & learning)**

- **Golang** for backend services and APIs  
- **FastAPI** for high-performance Python APIs  
- **Rust** for systems programming and high-performance tooling  

## 🚀 What I Do

- Build full-stack applications with Rails/Django on the backend and React/Next.js/Vue.js on the frontend  
- Design clean, maintainable architectures and write readable, tested code  
- Help turn ideas and messy processes into real, production-ready web platforms  
- Continuously learn and experiment with new tools, patterns, and best practices  

## 🧩 Side Projects

- **Studio Link** – A SaaS platform that helps studios and gyms manage classes, attendance, memberships, and payments in one place.  
- **Vayla** – A web app that streamlines dance competitions by automating judging and scoring, reducing manual work and errors.  
- **[New side project]** – Another product I’m currently building as a playground for Next.js / Go / FastAPI / Rust and experimentation with new ideas. *(Replace this line with the real name and link once it’s public.)*

## 💃 Fun Fact

When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me dancing bachata or salsa — sometimes even building tools for the dance world.

Let’s connect and build something great together!
Cuando tengas claro el nombre/URL de ese nuevo side project, solo cambias:

**[New side project]**
por algo tipo:

- **Sin Bronca** – PWA for splitting restaurant bills easily with friends, from scanning the ticket to sharing the final amounts.
o lo que aplique. Si me pasas el link y qué hace, te lo dejo escrito fino en una sola línea.

Si quieres, luego podemos reemplazar el [New side project] con Sin Bronca (o el proyecto que tú digas) cuando ya esté público.
